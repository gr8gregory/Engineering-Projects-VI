	<! This is where you input the title of your logbook entry >
	<h1>Week 1 Logbook Entry</h1>

	<! This is where you write your content for your logbook.>
	<p>
	This week one of the tasks I completed was I had built a framework to use the logbook on the website of the remote server.
	The framework consists of a main menu page that holds links to all of the seperate pages to each logbook entry per week.
	The framework I created is very barebones and contains a portion of CSS to style the entrys so everything looks better. 
	I also created a template that both caleb and Andrew have in their posession to copy and paste so all we have to do to write content in the logbooks and dont have to do any styling.
