		</ul>

		<h2 id='week1'>Week 1</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Set up Project Plan, dividing tasks equally and according to experience</li>
			<li>Added the project plan to the Confluence page for review and discussed it with team-mates</li>
			<li>Attempted STM32 HAL programming using STM32CubeMx and Atollic TrueSTUDIO but it didn't work</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2 id='week2'>Week 2</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Tested CAN interface on local STM32:
				<ol>
					<li>Finished setting up the CAN interface using the STM32 HAL introduction document from eConestoga (using STM32CubeIDE this time)</li>
					<li>Looked online to find how to run in loopback mode</li>
					<li>Tested the CAN interface by experimenting with filters</li>
					<li>
						Recorded a 
						<a href="../video.html#canHalDemo">video</a> 
						of it working
					</li>
					<li>
						Added the code to a separate 
						<a href="https://www.github.com/choeksema/Nucleo-F303RE_HAL_CAN" target=_blank title="Open repository in new tab">repository</a> 
						on Github
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Updated project plan as per last week's debrief</li>
			<li>Tested the VNC connection to the Raspberry Pi</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id='week3'>Week 3 </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Investigated Sabbath mode:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Not sure if we should have an overall on/off command for Sabbath mode, especially if Sabbath mode ignores regular commands so it still reaches all the floors consistently</li>
				<li>At least 3 options for operation:</li>
				<ol>
					<li>Stop at each floor up and down</li>
					<li>Stop at alternate floors up and down</li>
					<li>Rise all the way to the top and stop at each floor when going down only</li>
				</ol>
				<li>Overall process</li>
				<ol>
					<li>Check time and date</li>
					<li>If the Sabbath, move to the first floor and then start following the chosen procedure (one of those listed above) while ignoring regular commands</li>
					<li>If not the Sabbath, wait for user input</li>
				</ol>
			</ul>
			<li>Investigated the database</li>
			<ul>
				<li>The database already esists with implemented controls and C++/PHP code for interacting with the database. Do we use this or write our own?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Plan to ask at debrief</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</ul>
