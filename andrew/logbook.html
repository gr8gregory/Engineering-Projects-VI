	Tasks:
	-Created a confluence page to store all the teams information and methods. This helped streamline the teams development environment		so we can share our tips and tricks to work effecitvley.
	-Wrote a guide on how to use WSL for ssh, as well as how to access the VPN from the command line and make vpn aware commands. This 		allows a user to ssh into the pi using a single command and automates the start and the stop of the vpn
